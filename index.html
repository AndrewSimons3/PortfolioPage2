    <section id="about">
      My story begins in the small northeast corner of Texas in a town called Mt. Pleasant. At a young age I excelled in sports and eventually my passion for golf led me to Delta State University for college. Go fighting Okra! After school, I made my way back to Texas and have been in Austin since 2012. In recent years, I've found my passion for coding. When I'm not working on apps, I enjoy Crossfit, the Austin music scene, lady bird lake with my dog Simon, and discovering new restaurants with my girlfriend.
